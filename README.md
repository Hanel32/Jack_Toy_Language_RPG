# Jack_Toy_Language_RPG
Implementation of the C RPG from another repository into the JACK programming language, which is a toy language built specifically to be run on the logical processor that was implemented in the CSCE 312 class. For a closer look at the internals, check out the Python_Assembler repository to understand the byte commands.

The original idea came from the C_RPG that was implemented in my first programming class, and we essentially cleaned things up, made the dialogue and menus to fit the Jack framework, and finished the loose ends. There's maybe five minutes of gameplay, but the experience of making a game run on a virtual computer that was programmed, by us, from the ground up from primitive logic gates all the way to this high level language project.
